Extras
    HW0
    - [x] interesting images
    HW1a
    - [x] gently varying background (implemented but removed for better images, was a single line impl anyway)
    HW1b
    - [x] soft shadow
    HW1c
    - [x] parallel projection (not done properly)

Bug fixes
    - [x] Invalid number of args fix
    - [x] Output file name fix
    - [x] Accept empty lines
    - [x] Ignore unknown keywords
    - [x] Sometimes your rays go through triangles without detecting the intersection.
    - [x] Your texture parser doesnt always work, there might be newlines or whitespace at the end of a line.
    - [x] Your shadows aren't correct sometimes.
    - [x] texture paths
    - [x] 1c testcases
    - [x] 1d testcases
    - [ ] I see you did the parallel projection, but it pulls the camera extremely far back
