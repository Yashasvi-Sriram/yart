Bug fixes
    - [x] Invalid number of args fix
    - [x] Output file name fix
    - [x] Accept empty lines
    - [x] Ignore unknown keywords
    - [ ] Sometimes your rays go through triangles without detecting the intersection.
    - [ ] Your texture parser doesnt always work, there might be newlines or whitespace at the end of a line.
    - [ ] texture paths
    - [ ] Your shadows aren't correct sometimes.
    - [ ] I see you did the parallel projection, but it pulls the camera extremely far back
    - [ ] 1c testcases, 1d testcases
